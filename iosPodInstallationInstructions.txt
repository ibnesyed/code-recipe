I dont know exactly what I did, but I resolved my problem.

I updated MacOS and Xcode
I uninstalled cocoapods from gem gem uninstall cocoapods
I had some error while I was running bundle exec pod install. So I used sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app link
Then sudo xcodebuild -license accept
Then I ran installer npx react-native init template --template react-native-template-typescript and everything was good!
Also I can recommend you to use these commands to know where is your error

npx react-native init testproject --skip-install
cd testproject
yarn install
cd ios
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
bundle exec pod install pod repo update // <= for Firebase
